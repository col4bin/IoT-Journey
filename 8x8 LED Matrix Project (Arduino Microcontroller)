###WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF ARDUINO MICOCONTROLLERS!!! - This project is for programming an 8x8 LED Matrix###

###DISCLAIMER/TRANSPARENCY --> All of the code for this project came from Ardunio and then was edited for my environmengt and asthetic goals of the LED Matrix###

LED displays are often packaged as matrixes of LEDs arranged in rows of common anodes and columns of common cathodes, or the reverse

hese can be very useful displays. To control a matrix, you connect both its rows and columns to your microcontroller. The columns are connected to the LEDs cathodes, so a column needs to be LOW for any of the LEDs in that column to turn on. The rows are connected to the LEDs anodes, so the row needs to be HIGH for an individual LED to turn on. If the row and the column are both high or both low, no voltage flows through the LED and it doesn't turn on.

To control an individual LED, you set its column LOW and its row HIGH. To control multiple LEDs in a row, you set the row HIGH, then take the column high, then set the columns LOW or HIGH as appropriate; a LOW column will turn the corresponding LED ON, and a HIGH column will turn it off.

#CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION#
The 16 pins of the matrix are hooked up to 16 pins of the Arduino board. Four of the analog pins are used as digital inputs 16 through 19. The order of the pins is assigned in two arrays in the code.

Two potentiometers, connected to analog pins 0 and 1, control the movement of a lit LED in the matrix.

To keep your LED matrix from burning, add 8 10kÎ© resistors to the wires connected in yellow

/*
  Row-Column Scanning an 8x8 LED matrix with X-Y input

  This example controls an 8x8 LED matrix using two analog inputs.

  This example works for the Lumex LDM-24488NI Matrix. See
  https://sigma.octopart.com/140413/datasheet/Lumex-LDM-24488NI.pdf
  for the pin connections.

  For other LED cathode column matrixes, you should only need to change the pin
  numbers in the row[] and column[] arrays.

  rows are the anodes
  cols are the cathodes
  ---------

  Pin numbers:
  Matrix:
  - digital pins 2 through 13,
  - analog pins 2 through 5 used as digital 16 through 19
  Potentiometers:
  - center pins are attached to analog pins 0 and 1, respectively
  - side pins attached to +5V and ground, respectively
