As exciting and nerve racking as it was, my personal latop ###(Mac Book | 2020 M1 Chip | 13")### was exposed to Malware; resulting in having to flash the SSD and rest the computer from scratch. 

This was mny first time attempting support of this level and upon suceesful remediation; I wanted to share some of the process and shed light on my experience. 

@PROBLEM: Unknown .exe file found on the device. The file had esclated priviliges to a degree that did not allow me the permissions to delete. 

When using Amministrative Privileges you can start with the follwing if you have ran into our @problem###

del "C:\path\to\your\file.ext"

OR 

sudo rm -f /path/to/file


###If this does not work, restarting the computer and entering Recovery Mode will be the next area to investigate###

Command (âŒ˜) + R

OR 

HOLD Power Button when powering on, HOLD until you see "Entering Recovery Mode" 

###Side Notes: There are several Modes you can enter in order to troubleshoot various problems and errors found on Mac OS, here are some of the one used during my process. 
> Recovery Mode 
> Safe Mode
> Internet Recovery Mode 
> Diagnostics Mode 


@Problem when accessing ecovery mode for utilization of Disk Utility you can acess the various Disks, Volumes, and hard drives that house the opperating system and kernel processes. 
APPLE SSD AP0512Q Media 
> Container disk3
>> Macintosh HD (Volumes)
>>> Macintosh HD 
>>> Macintosh HD - Data 
Disk images :
> Apple disk image media 
>> container disk5
>>>macOS Base System 

###Typically you can utilize the Disk Utility tool to Erase the Main Disk/Top-Level Physical Disk0/HD SSD/Macintosh HD, and reupload the OS from Apple and start fresh. 

@Problem Disk Utility will not let me delete the Disk (cleaning the device of the malaciuos files)
###My specfic issue would not allow me to erase, unmount or create a new Disk, due to "in use by process 0 (kernel) Error: -69877". 

###The error message encountered indicates that the disk0 is still being held by the system (process 0 - kernel), and we will need to utilize the terminal to continue to troubleshoot the issue. 

Diskutil ###is the main command you will use and build off of in the Terminal. Below are some of the variotions that I tried, but was not successful in removing the Disk. These commands should work for most situations depended on the depth of the Malacious files and processes 

diskutil list #Identify Disk 

diskutil unmountDisk force /dev/disk0 ###Use Force 

diskutil apfs deleteContainer disk3 ###Delete surroundings to ideally kill the process holding on to our Disk0. 

IF YOU ARE SUCCESSFU
